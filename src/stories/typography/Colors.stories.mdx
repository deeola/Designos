# Color Concept

<br />

#### Colors Form the Basis

Colors influence the senses and help establish context to messages.
They are the visual basis of our corporate design at designo.
They are able to convey our identity and, when combined with other elements,
a recognizable appearance of the brand is created. Along with the logo,
the color palette we use is the element with most recognition potential.

<br />

## Color Palette

Our color palette consists of two levels: primary and secondary . Each palette has its own function and specific usage.

### Primary Colors

Our primary color gives the corporate design stability, harmony and earnestness. We have three types of primary colors.

<ColorInfo
  name="PEACH"
  color={{
    rgb: "231, 129, 107",
    hex: "#E7816B",
  }}
/>

<ColorInfo
  name="BLACK"
  color={{
    rgb: "29, 28, 30",
    hex: "#1D1C1E",
  }}
/>

<ColorInfo
  name="WHITE"
  color={{
    rgb: "255, 255, 255",
    hex: "#FFFFFF",
  }}
/>

### Secondary Colors

The palette of secondary colors is vivid and diversified. It stands for the international competence and innovative strength of Designo.

<ColorInfo
  name="LIGHT PEACH"
  color={{
    rgb: "255, 173, 155",
    hex: "#FFAD9B",
  }}
/>

<ColorInfo
  name="DARK GREY"
  color={{
    rgb: "51, 49, 54",
    hex: "#333136",
  }}
/>

<ColorInfo
  name="LIGHT GREY"
  color={{
    rgb: "241, 243, 245",
    hex: "#F1F3F5",
  }}
/>

## Don't Do This

Using the colors requires sensitivity and there are some principles that should be
considered:

- The colors should not be laid over photos as a transparent surface.
- Secondary colors should not be combined directly.
- The text color should have sufficient contrast to the background.
- There are no color gradients.
- Always use colors in combination with white space, this should predominate.
- Do not use more than one secondary color in typography.
- Only colors in this color concept should be used.
